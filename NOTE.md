## Beta feature:
Toad and Giant Toad are added. The toad targets bugs (e.g. spiders and silverfish), the giant toad targets every living creature, except for itself. At this moment, by default, they don't spawn naturally in the world. To summon them, use `/summon mobz:toad and /summon mobz:toad_giant` respectively.

Currently, the texture of the toad and the giant toad is from `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs`, it will be changed in the later release (no e.t.a), please help me if you are good at making models.

A new hostile creature - wasp is added, it exists for testing and does not spawn naturally.
